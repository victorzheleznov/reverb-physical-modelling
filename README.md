# Plate and spring reverb effects 

This repository contains two scripts for simulation of reverb effects using physical modelling:
1. `plate_reverb.m` —  plate reverb effect using modal synthesis.
2. `spring_reverb.m` —  spring reverb effect using simplified helical spring model.

Since simulation for spring reverb may take several minutes a demo impulse response `spring_reverb_ir.wav` is included in the repository.

All of the relevant references are provided within MATLAB scripts.
